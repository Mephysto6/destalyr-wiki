# DestalyrWiki

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.0.

## UwU what's this ?

This is the code for the Destalyr Wiki page available at [this address](https://destalyr-wiki.jutendo.eu/home).  
It started as a test of how to make my own website, and turned into a useful thing.
It is very much intended for players of Destalyr and will look weird to non players. Don't judge.

## Expectations

This whole website is a **side project**. Do not expect WordPress quality.  
It is being updated regularly (whenever I have both time and motivation), and I try to include more of the available tools that Angular provides,
but first and foremost to make the website prettier and more usable.
I will not include a thing just to include that thing if it does not have an **actual** use within the website.  
This is not a parade of what I can do with Angular. This is a wiki page for my players.

## Tour guide

Now that the warnings are out of the way, let's get to the fun part. How to visit the website -especially for the first time- depending on what you're looking for.  
[TODO]

# The boring stuff

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
